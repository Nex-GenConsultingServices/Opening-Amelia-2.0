# Opening-Amelia-2.0

DESCRIPTION
Amelia 1.0 was a class project conducted by myself and then later on in the development I joined forces with @Redlook096 and started to develop Amelia 1.0 faster.

Amelia 2.0 is the new and improved version of Amelia 1.0 and has new and improved features that are interesting. The new features that Amelia can do include:
